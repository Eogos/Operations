# Death Delivery Corps Repository
### The DDC Repository for misson-making content.

#### Missions
This is the main section of the repository.
All missions, templates, and mission PBOs are included in this folder.
Missions are to follow a set template, outlined by the ZeusTemplate.VR mission.

Missions are to have a description.ext included with the ACE_Settings Framework, and all license files from media, scripts, and other content are to be included with the mission, even if it is duplicated elsewhere in the repository.

##### Binarization
Do *NOT* binarize mission.sqm files. If using EDEN editor, disable the option. All commits with a binarized mission.sqm will be rejected.

#### Scripts
Any scripts added to the repo must have a licenses.txt included or added to them. This must be present in all places the script is present in, including the final PBOs.

#### Kits
Kits are now located in a seperate repository.
