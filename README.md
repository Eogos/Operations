# Global Security Coalition Operations Repository
### The GSC Repository for misson-making content.

#### Missions
This is the main section of the repository.
All missions, templates, and mission PBOs are included in this folder.
Missions are to follow a set template, outlined by the ZeusTemplate.VR mission.

All license files from media, scripts, and other content are to be included with the mission, even if it is duplicated elsewhere in the repository.

##### Binarization
Do *NOT* binarize mission.sqm files. If using EDEN editor, disable the option. All commits with a binarized mission.sqm will be rejected.

#### Scripts
Any scripts added to the repo must have a licenses.txt included or added to them. This must be present in all places the script is present in, including the final PBOs.
